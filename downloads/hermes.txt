# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the library's function. This will be
# shown from inside the PDE when the library is being installed. Avoid repeating
# the name of your library here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant like
# mentioning that its a library. This should start with a capitalized letter, and
# end with a period.
sentence = Experimental game framework and engine for rapid prototyping of games and simulations.

# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the
# second sentence here. If your library only works on certain operating systems,
# mention it here.
paragraph =  Leverges the strengths of Object-Oriented Design and the ease of Processing to make it easy to bring game mechanics to life. Built-in OSC support makes it easy to enable communication between your games and external data sources. Also includes animation/sprite and physics libraries that can be used outside the framework.
